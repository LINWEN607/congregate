# Contributing to Congregate

We love your input! We want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing/Contributing new features

## We Develop with GitLab

We use GitLab to host this project. We use Gitlab to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept merge requests.

## We identify new work (e.g. bugs or features requests, etc.) using GitLab issues

We use this project's gitlab issues board to track public bugs or feature request issues. Do this by [opening a new issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/migration/congregate/-/issues).

## We collaborate on all code changes through merge requests

You can find a list of merge requests [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/migration/congregate/-/merge_requests).

To make your first merge request with a proposed change:

1. Edit the file(s) using the WebIDE, single file editor using the GitLaB UI, or using your local development environment of choice.
1. Once you've made the changes you're proposing, commit it to a new branch and open a merge request to merge it into main/master.
1. On the create MR page:
   - Add details about why you want to make the proposed change and a summary of what those changes are.
   - In the description field, include `closes #<issue-number>` to associate the MR to an issue. If you don't have an issue associated with this work, create one!
