# Migration Workflow

## Pre-migration steps

### Pre-requisites and considerations

* For the most common questions, prerequisites and other details see our [Frequently Asked Migration Questions](customer/famq.md).
* GitLab admin Access Token with `api` scope (read and write, until more granular API scopes are available) for both source and destination instance
* Environment (VM, k8s, etc.) for running Congregate Docker image
  * Minimum environment requirements:
    * 4 CPU
    * 8 Gb RAM
    * 20 Gb of disk space (Docker mount volume)
  * Docker installed in order to pull the Congregate image from `registry.gitlab.com` and run a container
* GitLab source instance numbers and sizes:
  * Users (`active`, `blocked`, `ldap_blocked`, `deactivated`, `banned`)
  * Groups (top-level groups)
  * Projects (LFS, Container Registry Images) - may require breaking up into migration waves

``` mermaid

  A(Source considerations) --> |Users| B{Type}
  B --> C(Blocked)
  B --> D(Deactivated)
  B --> E(LDAP_Blocked)
  B --> F(Banned)
  A --> |Groups| G(Top-level)
  A --> |Projects| H{Features}
  H --> I(LFS)
  H --> J(Container Registry Images)
```

* GitLab destination instance considerations:
  * Enable Shared Runners (Default: `True`)?
  * Migrate to parent group i.e. new top-level group (parent group ID in **Group -> Settings -> General**)?
  * Append username suffix to avoid username collision (duplicate usernames for users NOT found by email)?
  * Keep inactive (`blocked`, `ldap_blocked`, `deactivated`, `banned`) users (Default: `False`)?
  * Send user password reset link (via email) upon their creation (Default: `True`)?
  * Set newly created user password to a random value (Default: `False`)?

``` mermaid
graph TD
  A(Destination considerations) --> |True| B(Enable shared runners)
  A --> |?| D(Migrate to parent group)
  A --> |?| E(Append username suffix)
  A --> |False| F(Keep inactive users)
  A --> |True| G(Reset pwd)
  A --> |False| H(Force random pwd)
```

* Export storage considerations - for storing group and project archives (exports), container registry images, logs
  * Local filesystem :white_check_mark:
  * AWS S3 bucket
    * Projects :white_check_mark:
    * Groups :heavy_minus_sign:
  * Hybrid (Filesystem-AWS) :heavy_minus_sign:

``` mermaid
graph TD
  A(Export storage) --> |Groups & Projects| B(Filesystem)
  A --> |Projects| C(AWS S3)
```

### Timing and Planning

* Users:
  * Disable email notifications (request destination instance Admin or GitLab Support)
  * Broadcast message on source instance
* Groups - small in size, only the Groupâ€™s tree structure is exported / imported
* Projects - due to cut-over time and size constraints we may break them down into separate waves of even size and grouped by parent group

## Migration Steps

### Dry-run

``` mermaid
graph TD
  A(Staged)--> |Users| B{Dry-run}
  A--> |Groups| B{Dry-run}
  A--> |Projects| B{Dry-run}
  B --> |Users| C(Dry-run logs)
  B --> |Groups| D(Dry-run logs)
  B --> |Projects| E(Dry-run logs)
```

### Migrate users

``` mermaid
graph TD
  A(Stage ALL Users) --> B{Inspect}
  B --> |Found| C(Skip)
  B --> |Not found| D{Remove inactive?}
  D --> |Yes| E(Remove, Dry-run & Inspect)
  E --> F(Migrate)
  D --> |No| G(Dry-run & Inspect)
  G --> H(Migrate and block on destination)
```

### Migrate groups & sub-groups

``` mermaid
graph TD
  A(Stage ALL top-level groups w/ sub-groups) --> B(Dry-run & Inspect)
  B --> C(Migrate)
```

### Migrate projects

``` mermaid
graph TD
  A(Stage Projects) --> |All| B(Dry-run & Inspect)
  B --> C(Migrate)
  A --> |Waves| D{Break into waves}
  D --> E(Dry-run & Inspect)
  E --> F(Migrate Wave 1)
  D --> G(Dry-run & Inspect)
  G --> H(Migrate Wave 2)
  D --> I(Dry-run & Inspect)
  I --> J(Migrate Wave n)
```

### Rollback

``` mermaid
graph TD
  A(Migrated users) --> B{Hard delete}
  B --> |Yes| C(Dry-run & Inspect)
  C --> D(Rollback with contributions)
  B --> |No| E(Dry-run & Inspect)
  E --> F(Rollback)
  G(Migrated groups) --> H(Dry-run & Inspect)
  H --> I(Rollback)
  J(Migrated projects) --> K(Dry-run & Inspect)
  K --> L(Rollback)
```
