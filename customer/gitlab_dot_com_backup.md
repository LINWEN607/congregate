# Overview

It's crucial to ensure that data integrity, availability, and recovery options are well-maintained. There are several recommendations and options along with their pros and cons.

In terms of general backup strategy being done by GitLab.com itself to maintain customer data in the event of problems on Gitlab side, review the documentation here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/get_started.html#back-up-gitlab-saas

For the GitLab.com Infrastructure Department FAQ, review the documentation here: https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/faq/

It's important to note that this is **not** meant as a replacement for a Customer's backup strategy, as we do not offer recovery options for actions that were taken by a customer. The offical documented option is:

__"...our overall recommendation is to export projects and store them externally."__

This is accomplished by most of the suggestions below, but each of the suggestions add additional features or meet requirements frequently required of customers.

## GitLab.com Backup Features

[File-based project export/import](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/project_import_export.html):

- **Pros**:
  - GitLab.com provides built-in backup features accessible through the web interface or via API in the form of export and import.
  - Easy to manage within the GitLab interface.
- **Cons**:
  - Limited control over backup frequency and retention policies compared to custom solutions.
  - May not cover all aspects of the GitLab environment, such as CI/CD configurations or custom settings.
  - [Group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/import_export.html#rate-limits-1) and [project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/import_export.html#rate-limits) export rate limits

## Third-party Backup Solutions

[Git Protect](https://gitprotect.io/gitlab.html)

[Backup Labs](https://backuplabs.io)

- **Pros**:
  - Leverage third-party backup solutions designed specifically for GitLab environments.
  - Offer advanced features such as granular recovery, encryption, and customizable retention policies to meet regulatory or compliance requirements.
- **Cons**:
  - Costlier compared to in-house or basic backup solutions.
  - Dependency on external vendors and potential compatibility issues with future GitLab updates.

## Custom Export and Version Control

- **Pros**:
  - Periodically export (`git clone`) critical GitLab data and store it in version-controlled repositories (e.g. Git).
  - Provides complete control over backup frequency, retention, and versioning.
- **Cons**:
  - Labor-intensive and prone to human error, especially in large environments.
  - Requires careful management of access controls and encryption for sensitive data.
  - Currently implemented methods only do the default branch and do not account for all the existing branch sprawl.

## Repository Mirroring

[Repository mirroring](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/mirror) is a feature in GitLab that allows you to create a duplicate copy (mirror) of your project's repository on another Git server. This can be useful as a form of backup or disaster recovery.

- **Pros**:
  - Can provide a usable failover method in the event Gitlab.com becomes unavailable.
  - Is mostly hands-off once setup.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires managing additional infrastructure (the target of the mirror) along with firewall rules and other settings.
  - Cannot be used as a [hot spare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_spare) for the code, as there is risks with push/pull configurations and many interlocked mechanisms do not play well.

## Summary

When choosing a backup strategy for GitLab.com, it's essential to consider factors such as:

- data sensitivity
- recovery objectives
- budget constraints
- existing infrastructure

A combination of these options might provide the best balance between data protection, availability, and cost-effectiveness.

Regular testing and evaluation of backup and recovery procedures are also crucial to ensure readiness for any unforeseen events.

It's essential to evaluate the features, pricing, and compatibility of each solution to choose the one that best meets your organization's backup requirements.
