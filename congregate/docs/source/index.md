# Welcome to Congregate\'s documentation\!

Congregate is an internal tool for GitLab professional services to handle migrating customers to GitLab. Congregate currently supports the following migration directions:

* Self-managed to gitlab.com
* Self-managed to self-managed

Our guidance on some other migrations at this time:

* Bitbucket
  * While there is some code in congregate for a BitBucket migration, we would suggest customers use the internal BitBucket importer. 
  * If scale is a concern for customers, please reach out to professional services for a consulting services quote.
* GitHub
  * We have a [built-in importer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/github.html) for importing from GitHub
* SVN
  * We have some [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/svn.html) on gitlab.com discussing migrating from SVN
